
JasperReports Library 6.3.1 Change Log
=============================================

- new JSONQL query language with advanced syntax for queries and for field mapping 
expressions to allow more complex field mapping scenarios including the ability to map 
fields to the parent node values; this new query language and its respective query executer, 
which offers XPath-like capabilities, deprecate the existing JSON query language and 
the former query executer;

- support for request headers was added to HTTP data adapters as well as improved 
parameter mapping using custom parameter properties to markup dataset parameters which 
contribute to the HTTP request; the new sample under /demo/samples/httpdataadapters shows 
some of these improvements;

- new evaluationTime attribute added to dataset parameter definition to control the exact 
moment when the default value expression of the parameter is evaluated; the default evaluation 
time for parameters which do not specify a value for the attribute is controlled using the
net.sf.jasperreports.parameter.evaluation.time configuration property;

- support for property expressions added for dataset fields to allow more flexibility in 
data source and query executer field mapping;

- the use of the fieldDescription attribute in data source and query executer field mapping 
is now deprecated by the introduction of special field level custom properties for each type 
of data source and query executer;

- support for property expressions in dataset was added to allow more flexibility in dataset 
and report configuration, including the ability to control export properties using report parameters; 
the report and dataset property expressions can be evaluated at different moments and this is 
controlled by the their evaluationTime attribute; when evaluationTime attribute is not specified 
for a property expression, it defaults to the value specified by the 
net.sf.jasperreports.property.evaluation.time configuration property;

- multiple chart customizer objects can be registered per chart element using new configuration 
properties having the net.sf.jasperreports.customizer.class.{arbitrary_name} format; 
the new sample under /demo/samples/chartcustomizers introduces a set of pre-defined chart 
customizers which are ready to use in reports;

- the data adapter extension is now enabled by default in all JasperReports deployments;

- the XLS, XLSX, DOCX and PPTX exporters were enhanced to support specifying metadata 
information such as title, subject, author, keywords and creator application for the 
generated documents using export configuration properties;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
